Vincent and Leah worked on this lab individually to start, but pair programmed and debugged most of lab6 together.

Vincent work individually on Friday, October 25 from 4 pm to 6 pm in the MacLeod buildingd
We worked together on Sunday, October 27th from 3 pm to 1 am in the MacLeod building.
We worked together individually on Monday October 28th to finish the project 

All of the code in lab6 is either our own, provided to us via the source files on piazza, or from the slides/textbook.
In other words, we did not use someone else's lab5.

The following is a breakdown of the submitted code:

Some edits were made to all lab5 files by both lab partners.

lab_top.v was updated by Vincent

cpu.v was updated by Leah

lab7_tb was made by Vincent

RAM was copied from slideset 7

Debugging:
The bulk of time on this lab was spent debugging. The following were SOME of the bugs we encountered and how we fixed them:
-There wasn't enough cycles for STR and LDR to load correctly, we discovered it after making some
buffer state to check.

-The switches and LED aren't connected because we accidently flipped the variables when writing the constant

-Most of the bugs occurs when writing over the old code because sometimes we forget to change the 
variables when we needed to change. So a lot of the time is spent following the signal changes
in modelsim until we see where its diconnected or passing the wrong values
