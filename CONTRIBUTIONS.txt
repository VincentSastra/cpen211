Vincent and Leah pair programmed and debugged most of lab8 together. Some implementations for the bonus marks were done individually.

We worked together on Saturday, Nov 2 from 1 pm to 6 pm in the MacLeod building.
We worked together on Sunday, Nov 3 from 2pm to 5 pm in ICCS.
We worked individually between Sunday evening and Monday morning to implement the interrupt bonus.
We worked together on Monday, Nov 4 from 11 am to 2 pm to finish debugging the bonus and to submit the lab.

All of the code in lab5, lab6, and lab7 is either our own, provided to us via the source files on piazza, or from the slides/textbook.
In other words, we did not use someone else's labs to complete lab8.

The following is a breakdown of the submitted code:

Some edits were made to all lab8 files by both lab partners.

cpu.v was updated by Vincent and Leah (pair programmed)

lab8_top.v (formely lab7_top.v) was updated by Vincent and Leah (pair programmed)

cpu.v was updated by Vincent (for interrupt bonus)

datapath.v was updated by Leah (for interrupt bonus)

Testbench for BLX bonus was written by Leah

Testbench for interrupt bonus was written by Vincent



Debugging - non-bonus section:
There was not a lot of debugging to be done for the bulk of this lab. Because we were able to use our working previous labs and because of the expandability of our design, we were able to implement branching and function calls relatively easily.

Debugging - BLX bonus:
Again, limited debugging; however, we did use the waveform viewer in ModelSim to realize that we needed to modify the testbench we were using to look in a memory address that corresponded to the number of commands we issued.

Debugging - Interrupt bonus:
Most the time spent on this bonus was spent in designing the solution to the problem and the testbench.
